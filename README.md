## Docker for Pentesters

### Description
In today's technological era, Docker is the most powerful technology across various domains, whether it's Development, Cybersecurity, DevOps, Automation, or Infrastructure.

Considering the demand of the industry, I would like to introduce my idea to create **NIGHTINGALE**: a Docker image for pentesters.

This Docker image provides a ready-to-use environment with the tools required for pentesting across different scopes, including web application penetration testing, network penetration testing, mobile, API, OSINT, or Forensics.

The best part is that you can either create an altered Docker image or pull the pre-built Docker image from the hub.

Some of the best features are listed below; I would highly recommend going through them before starting to penetrate the application. **Link to access tool list**: ([tool list](https://github.com/RAJANAGORI/Nightingale/wiki/6.-Tools-list))

### Pros
- Pre-installed penetration testing tools and frameworks
- ﻿﻿Consistent and repeatable testing environments via Docker
- ﻿﻿Fast booting and tearing down of testing environments
- ﻿﻿Resource-efficient operation suitable for users with limited resources
- ﻿﻿Browser-based access using the local IP address
- ﻿﻿Platform independence, enhancing accessibility and usability
- ﻿﻿Go binary support for deploying Nightingale on any architecture.
- ﻿﻿Compatibility with both AMD and ARM architectures.
- ﻿﻿C/CD integration for automated vulnerability scanning.
- ﻿﻿Maintenance of GitHub Advisories, ensuring consumers have access to the latest images.
- ﻿﻿On-demand installation via a request form, allowing consumers to request specific tools.
- ﻿﻿GUI based solution for those who has love-hate relation with CLI.

### Why?
The reason behind creating this Docker image is to make a platform-independent penetration toolkit. It includes all the useful tools that a penetration tester might need (refer to the tool list section for details).

Please feel free to contribute to the tool.
